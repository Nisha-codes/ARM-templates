The aim of this little project is to deploy an infratructure using Azure Resource Mangager templates
This repository consists of a zipped application, ARM templates file and parameters file. I began by creating and deploying a resource group, then a storage account. I then created an azure app service and web app.
I created a static html file, zipped it and deployed the code to my azure web app. I confirmed the web app can use the storage account by checking the web app has the connection string of the storage account by running a code which returned the storage account end point and keys.

**--Deployed infrastructure using ARM template, Created web app and storage account and, configured app settings (Connection string)--**
